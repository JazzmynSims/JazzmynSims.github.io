    Hello World! My name is Jazzmyn Sims a 21-year-old junior at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. I came into the University as a Health Professions major Pre-Med track with the idea of becoming an Anesthesiologist. Shortly after I moved over to the engineering and technology side of things. My major is Information Technology with the School of Engineering with a follow-up minor study in Human Development and Family Science. Previously I took INFOTC 2810 Web Application Development but withdrew at the end of the semester. That was, to say the least, a rigorous course at the time. As a result, I have a handful of web programming knowledge. My expectations for this course are to simply perfect my craft and develop a valid understanding of web development. I hope to learn and grow within this course. Hobbies? Painting, whether on canvas or digitally, listening to music, and producing TikToks are a few of my favorite pastimes. I used to play the guitar, piano, clarinet, and viola when I was younger.
