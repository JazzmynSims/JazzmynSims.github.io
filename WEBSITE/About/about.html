        <h2>University of Missouri, <b>Engineering Scholar</b></h2>

        <p>
            Hello World! My name is Jazzmyn Sims a 21-year-old junior at the <em>University of Missouri </em> in Columbia, Missouri. My major is in Information Technology with the School of Engineering with a follow-up minor study in Human Development and Family Science. I have a few great careers in mind, but I haven't made up my mind yet. My expected graduation date for completion is December 2023. <br> I attended to <em> Muriel Williams Battle High School </em>, home of the Spartans also in Columbia, Missouri. I was involved in a few extracurriculars such as band, orchestra (first chair), AVID board committee and MAC Scholars to name a few. I graduated in 2019 with honors, placing me in the top 20% of my class. A few astonishing accomplishments I achieved are list of scholarships I received, being 1 of the 5 students to create a fully functional Black History Month Assembly for our entire school (2019), and last but not least I was given the opportunity to be 1 of the 15 artists to paint a mural downtown Columbia. I am capable of achieving everything I set my mind to! I'm excited to see what this bright future has in store for myself! 

        </p>
